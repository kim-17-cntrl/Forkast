      <h1>About Forkast</h1>
      <p>
        Forkast is made as a tool for UCSC students and community members
        yearning to eat sustainably and affordbly. We connect students to food
        resources, from pop-ups to farmers markets, and promote eco-conscious
        and nutricious food choices which offers an alternative to the
        neoliberal system of food shortages, and inflation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forkast is designed as a helpful tool for UCSC students who are eager to
        eat more sustainably and affordably. We aim to connect students with
        local food resources—ranging from campus pop-ups and community events to
        farmers markets—while promoting eco-conscious food habits that benefit
        both individuals and the environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forkast also serves as a guide for students navigating local food
        systems, whether you're trying to budget for groceries, find healthier
        options, or discover new ways to eat with intention. From passionate
        food lovers to those just starting their sustainability journey, Forkast
        is here to support you in making smarter, greener, and more connected
        food choices.
