      <h1>About Forkast</h1>
      <p>
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
        Forkast is made as a tool for UCSC students and community members yearning to eat sustainably and affordbly.
        We connect students to food resources, from pop-ups to farmers markets,
        and promote eco-conscious and nutricious food choices which offers an alternative to the neoliberal system of food shortages, and inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to empower our local community to engage with smaller food systems, eat for the enviornment, seasonally, and
        reduce waste. All the while, embracing the power of nourishing your body while helping the enviornment, as it should and can be. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From pasisonate concious eaters to those looking to support local food systems, Forkast is the tool to help unify these interests.

        Forkast is designed as a helpful tool for UCSC students who are eager to
        eat more sustainably and affordably. We aim to connect students with
        local food resources—ranging from campus pop-ups and community events to
        farmers markets—while promoting eco-conscious food habits that benefit
        both individuals and the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to empower communities to make more mindful food choices
        by learning about sustainable eating, understanding the impact of
        seasonal foods, and reducing food waste. We believe that nourishing your
        body can go hand-in-hand with taking care of the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forkast also serves as a guide for students navigating local food
        systems, whether you're trying to budget for groceries, find healthier
        options, or discover new ways to eat with intention. From passionate
        food lovers to those just starting their sustainability journey, Forkast
        is here to support you in making smarter, greener, and more connected
        food choices.
